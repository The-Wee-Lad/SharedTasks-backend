- **Priority & Deadlines**: Assign priority levels and deadlines to ensure timely task completion.

### Collaboration & Role Management

- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define roles such as "Admin", "Member", or "Viewer" for team members, controlling access and permissions across the platform.
- **Invite Collaborators**: Admins can invite users to join task lists, assigning them specific roles for collaboration.

### Project Management

- **Organize Tasks into Task Lists**: Group tasks under organized task lists to manage projects and initiatives more effectively.
- **Public/Private Task Lists**: Control visibility by making task lists public for team-wide access or private for restricted users.
- **Permissions for Task Lists**: Admins can control who has access to each task list, with customizable settings for each role.

### Invitation & Access Control

- **Send Invitations**: Admins can invite users to join task lists and assign them roles.
- **Accept or Reject Invitations**: Collaborators can accept or reject invitations based on their availability or preference.
